### On Your Turn
- Left click a tile in your hand to select it

### Money System
- Money is granted after every time you play a word
- Harder letters such as "X", "Q", and "W" will grant more money as opposed to vowels or common consonants
- Any word longer than three letters is given a multiplier based on how long it is
### Advanced Features
- To access the upgrades, click the arrow on the right of your screen to pull out the menu, and purchase upgrades if you have enough money
#### Letters Per Turn Upgrade
- Upgrading this will give you more letters back every time you end your turn.
#### Strategy
- As your opponent's tiles are not hidden from your view, it may be useful to see what they have before playing your word
- Ex. not playing a word that can be made plural with an "S" if your opponent has one.
